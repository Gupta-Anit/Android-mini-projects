Time: Finite, and now well managed. <br/>
Turn mute and vibrate on/off custom to your schedule. <br/>
Simple. Easy.
<strong><a href="http://autosettings.googlecode.com/">Timeriffic</a></strong>.
<br/>
No useless features.
<br/>
Won't hurt your battery!

Example: Got class M, W, F at 8am (we're sorry for ya),
use Timeriffic to:
<ul>
<li> un-mute your volume from 7am - 8am during the ride to class,
<li> switch to vibrate at 8am,
<li> and then back to full volume at 9am.
</ul>
(If you're a grownup substitute "class" with "work").

adds the following new features:
<ul>
<li> Profiles let you group actions together and enable or disable them at once.
<li> Actions can be set for given days, such as actions for the week days and others for the week-end.
</ul>

A couple of default profiles are provided to get you started.
<p/>
To edit a profile, use long press on a profile item or an action item.
A menu will appear to let you edit, insert or delete the item.
