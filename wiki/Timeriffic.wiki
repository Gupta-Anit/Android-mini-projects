Example: Got class M, W, F at 8am (we're sorry for ya),
use Timeriffic to:
  * un-mute your volume from 7am - 8am during the ride to class,
  * switch to vibrate at 8am,
  * and then back to full volume at 9am.

(If you're a grownup substitute "class" with "work").

To edit a profile, use long press on a profile item or an action item.
A menu will appear to let you edit, insert or delete the item.
