_Time: Finite, and now well managed._ <br>
_Turn mute and vibrate on/off custom to your schedule._ <br>
_Simple. Easy._
*[http://autosettings.googlecode.com/ Timeriffic]*.<br>
_No useless features._ <br>
_Won't hurt your battery!_

Example: Got class M, W, F at 8am (we're sorry for ya),
use Timeriffic to:
  * un-mute your volume from 7am - 8am during the ride to class,
  * switch to vibrate at 8am,
  * and then back to full volume at 9am.

(If you're a grownup substitute "class" with "work").

Version 1.3 adds the following new features:
  * Profiles let you group actions together and enable or disable them at once.
  * Actions can be set for given days, such as actions for the week days and others for the week-end.
