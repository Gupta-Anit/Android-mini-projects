<strong><a href="http://autosettings.googlecode.com/">Brighteriffic</a></strong>
let's you toggle the global screen brightness using a Home shortcut.

Note that Android does not normally allow third part applications such as
this one to change the global brightness.
Brighteriffic uses a work-around to be able to do this.
<p/>

Actually, Brighteriffic uses 2 methods to change the brightness, depending
on whether your phone runs with Android 1.1-1.5 (a.k.a. "Cupcake") or
Android 1.6 ("Donut") or 2.0 ("Eclair").
<p/>

<b>Know Issues:</b>
<ul>
<li>
In Donut and Eclair, the way Brighteriffic works makes the screen flicker
for a short period of time -- it gets darker and then goes back to the
requested brightness. This is due to the way Brighteriffic works and is
not an issue with your phone.
</li>

<li>
Some phones (Droid, HeroC) have a new feature called "Auto Brightness"
accessible from <code>Settings &gt; Sound &amp; Display &gt; Brightness</code>.
When auto-brightness is enabled, Brighteriffic will have no effect
and the brightness will not change.
</li>
</ul>
