<p/><hr/><h2> What is Timeriffic? </h2>

<em>
Time: Finite, and now well managed. <br/>
Turn mute and vibrate on/off custom to your schedule. <br/>
Simple. Easy.
<strong><a href="http://autosettings.googlecode.com/">Timeriffic</a></strong>.
<br/>
No useless features.
<br/>
Won't hurt your battery!
</em>

<p/>

Example: Got class M, W, F at 8am (we're sorry for ya),
use Timeriffic to:
<ul>
<li> un-mute your volume from 7am - 8am during the ride to class, </li>
<li> switch to vibrate at 8am, </li>
<li> and then back to full volume at 9am. </li>
</ul>
(If you're a grownup substitute "class" with "work").

<p/></hr><h2> What's new? </h2>

<p/>
Version 1.3 adds the following new features:
<ul>
<li> Profiles let you group actions together and enable or disable them at once. </li>
<li> Actions can be set for given days, such as actions for the week days and others for the week-end. </li>
</ul>

A couple of default profiles are provided to get you started.
<p/>
To edit a profile, use long press on a profile item or an action item.
A menu will appear to let you edit, insert or delete the item.

<p/><hr/><h2> Profile screen </h2>

<table border="0"><tr><td valign="top">
<img src="img13_proflist.png" />
</td><td valign="top" cellpadding="10">
The "profile list" screen is what you see when Timeriffic starts.
<p/>

One this screen you can do the following:
<p/>

<img src="img13_maintoggle.png"/>
<br/>
<em><b>Timeriffic Enable</b></em> or <em><b>Timeriffic Disabled</b></em>:
Enable or disable Timeriffic as a whole by using the top-left toggle.

<ul><li>
    <img align="right" src="img13_checknow.png"/>
    <em><b>Check Now</b></em>: Click this button to ask Timeriffic to refresh its state.
    The current settings will be applied, which is useful in case you changed
    them manually. A brief message will appear telling you when the next
    change will happen.
</li></ul>

<ul><li>
    <img align="right" src="img13_profheaderline.png"/>
    The purple lines are <em><b>profiles</b></em> names. Each profile lets you add one or
    more timed actions. Click on the profile checkbox to enable or disable it.
    Use long-press on a profile name to display a menu that will let you
    change its name, delete it or add more items.
</li></ul>

<ul><li>
    <img align="right" src="img13_timedactionline.png"/>
    The black lines are <em><b>timed actions</b></em>. These define what action
    happens at the specified time, on the specified days.
    Click on the action to edit it.
    Long-press the action to display a menu that lets you edit it, delete it
    or add more items.
</ul>
