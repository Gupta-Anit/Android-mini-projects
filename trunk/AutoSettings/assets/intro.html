<strong><a href="http://autosettings.googlecode.com/">Timeriffic</a></strong>
 	does one thing: it can mute or un-mute the global Android ringer at a
	specified time of the day.

<p/>
    Out of the box the application does exactly 2 things: 
    <ul>
    <li>At 21:00, it mutes the ringer and enables vibration. </li>
    <li>At 9:00, it restores the ringer and reverts the vibration to its default. </li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>That&#x27;s all there&#x27;s about it. Really. 
    Except you can choose a few settings, as seen below. </p>
    <p>As it is implemented right now, it&#x27;s sort of like 
    <a href="http://www.androidlocale.com/" rel="nofollow">Locale</a> 
    without the annoying UI, without the annoying GPS being enabled all the time, 
    without the stupid bug where it doesn&#x27;t work if start &gt; end in time ranges, 
    without the fancy yet useless GPS selection map and without ruining your battery.
