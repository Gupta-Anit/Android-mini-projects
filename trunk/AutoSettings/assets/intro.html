<em>
Time: Finite, and now well managed. <br/>
Turn mute and vibrate on/off custom to your schedule. <br/>
Simple. Easy.
<strong><a href="http://autosettings.googlecode.com/">Timeriffic</a></strong>.
<br/>
No useless features.
<br/>
Won't hurt your battery!
</em>
<p/>

Example: Got class M, W, F at 8am (we're sorry for ya),
use Timeriffic to:
<ul>
<li> un-mute your volume from 7am - 8am during the ride to class, </li>
<li> switch to vibrate at 8am, </li>
<li> and then back to full volume at 9am. </li>
</ul>
(If you're a grownup substitute "class" with "work").

<a name="known"><h2>Known Issues</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>
In Donut and Eclair, the way Timeriffic works makes the screen flicker
for a short period of time -- it gets darker and then goes back to the
requested brightness. This is due to the way Timeriffic works and is
not an issue with your phone.
</li>

<li>
Some phones (Droid, HeroC) have a new feature called "Auto Brightness"
accessible from <code>Settings &gt; Sound &amp; Display &gt; Brightness</code>.
When auto-brightness is enabled, Timeriffic will have no effect
and the brightness will not change.
</li>
</ul>
